## Detailed Project Explanation

### Kalman Filter Components

1. **State Transition Matrix (F)**: 
   - Models drone movement dynamics assuming constant velocity.
   - Represents how the state evolves between time steps.

2. **Observation Matrix (H)**: 
   - Maps the full state space to the measurement space.
   - Extracts position information from the state vector.

3. **Noise Covariance Matrices**:
   - **Process Noise (Q)**: Represents uncertainty in the system's movement.
   - **Measurement Noise (R)**: Represents sensor measurement uncertainty.

### Tracking Algorithm Workflow

1. **Data Generation**
   - Create synthetic drone position data
   - Introduce controlled noise to simulate real-world measurements
   - Save data to CSV for processing

2. **Kalman Filter Tracking**
   - Initialize state estimates for each drone
   - Predict next state based on previous estimates
   - Update state using new noisy observations
   - Compute refined position estimates

## Performance Characteristics

- Significantly reduces position estimation error
- Handles multiple simultaneous drone tracking
- Adaptable to varying noise levels
- Computationally efficient state estimation

## Potential Use Cases

- Logistics drone fleet management
- Autonomous drone navigation
- Swarm robotics tracking
- Sensor fusion in robotics
- Predictive positioning systems

## Mathematical Background

The Kalman filter is based on a recursive algorithm that:
- Estimates the state of a system
- Minimizes mean squared error
- Uses a series of noisy measurements over time

Key equations include:
- State Prediction: x̂ₖ⁻ = Fₖ x̂ₖ₋₁
- Measurement Update: x̂ₖ = x̂ₖ⁻ + Kₖ(zₖ - Hₖx̂ₖ⁻)

## Performance Metrics

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Position Accuracy
- Noise Reduction Ratio
